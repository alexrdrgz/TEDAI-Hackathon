# Edit Task Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete workflow that allows users to edit email and calendar tasks from toast notifications by opening a chat interface, making edits with AI assistance, and executing the final action.

## Architecture Flow

1. **User sees toast notification** → Contains Approve/Edit/Reject buttons
2. **User clicks Edit** → Chrome extension opens frontend chat in new window
3. **Chat auto-loads task** → Task details are fetched and presented to AI
4. **User edits with AI** → Conversational editing with AI assistance
5. **AI calls tool** → `send_email` or `create_calendar_event` tool is invoked
6. **Task executed** → New task created in Chrome extension queue
7. **Original task deleted** → Cleanup and confirmation shown

## Implementation Details

### 1. Toast Notification (`chrome-extension/toast-notification.js`)
- ✅ Added "Edit" button (✎ icon) between Approve and Reject
- ✅ Added green button styling for edit action
- ✅ Implemented `editTask()` function that sends EDIT_TASK message to background
- ✅ Added edit buttons to both notification and queue views

### 2. Chrome Extension Background (`chrome-extension/background.js`)
- ✅ Added EDIT_TASK message handler
- ✅ Stores task data temporarily in chrome.storage.local
- ✅ Opens new popup window at `http://localhost:3000?taskId=X&taskType=Y`
- ✅ Window size: 1000x800px, focused

### 3. Backend API (`backend/src/routes/index.ts`)
- ✅ `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Retrieve specific task by ID
- ✅ `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task data
- ✅ `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task after completion

### 4. Backend Database (`backend/src/services/db.ts`)
- ✅ `getTaskById()` - Fetch task by ID
- ✅ `updateTask()` - Update task type and data
- ✅ `deleteTask()` - Remove task from database

### 5. Backend Tools (`backend/src/services/tools/`)

#### sendEmail.ts
- ✅ Tool name: `send_email`
- ✅ Parameters: to, subject, body, cc (optional), bcc (optional)
- ✅ Creates new task in database for Chrome extension to execute
- ✅ Returns confirmation message with details

#### createCalendarEvent.ts
- ✅ Tool name: `create_calendar_event`
- ✅ Parameters: title, startTime, endTime, description, location, attendees
- ✅ Validates date formats (ISO 8601)
- ✅ Creates new task in database
- ✅ Returns formatted confirmation message

#### index.ts
- ✅ Registered both new tools in `initializeTools()`
- ✅ Tools available to Gemini AI

### 6. Backend System Prompt (`backend/src/services/gemini/chat.ts`)
- ✅ Added explicit documentation about send_email and create_calendar_event tools
- ✅ Instructions for when and how to use these tools
- ✅ Guidance on gathering necessary details before calling tools

### 7. Frontend API (`frontend/lib/api.ts`)
- ✅ `Task` interface definition
- ✅ `getTask(taskId)` - Fetch task details from backend
- ✅ `updateTask(taskId, type, data)` - Update task
- ✅ `deleteTask(taskId)` - Remove task

### 8. Frontend Chat Interface (`frontend/components/chat-interface.tsx`)
- ✅ Uses `useSearchParams()` to detect taskId and taskType in URL
- ✅ Loads task data on mount when parameters present
- ✅ Auto-injects initial message with task details
- ✅ Shows "Editing {type} task" indicator at top of chat
- ✅ Monitors AI responses for completion indicators
- ✅ Auto-deletes original task when "✓ Email prepared" or "✓ Calendar event prepared" detected
- ✅ Shows success toast notification

## How It Works

### Email Editing Example:

1. User sees toast: "New email task"
2. Clicks "Edit" button
3. Chat window opens with: "I'd like to edit this email task: To: john@example.com, Subject: Meeting..."
4. User: "Change the subject to 'Quick sync about project'"
5. AI: "I'll update that. Should I send it now?"
6. User: "Yes, send it"
7. AI calls `send_email` tool with updated details
8. Tool creates task in Chrome extension queue
9. Frontend detects completion, deletes original task
10. Toast: "Task has been prepared and will open shortly!"
11. Gmail compose window opens with updated email

### Calendar Editing Example:

1. User sees toast: "New calendar task"
2. Clicks "Edit" button
3. Chat opens with event details
4. User: "Move it to 3pm instead of 2pm"
5. AI updates the time
6. User: "Create the event"
7. AI calls `create_calendar_event` with new time
8. Tool creates task in extension queue
9. Frontend cleans up original task
10. Google Calendar opens with updated event

## Key Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Chrome extension, backend, and frontend work together
- **Conversational Editing**: Natural language interaction with AI
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Original tasks are deleted after successful creation
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators showing editing mode
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages at each step
- **Tool-based Execution**: AI autonomously calls appropriate tools

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Click Edit on email toast notification
- [ ] Verify chat window opens with task details
- [ ] Make edits through conversation
- [ ] Confirm AI calls send_email tool
- [ ] Verify Gmail opens with edited email
- [ ] Verify original task is deleted
- [ ] Repeat for calendar events
- [ ] Test error cases (invalid dates, missing fields)
- [ ] Test queue view edit buttons

## Notes

- Frontend URL is hardcoded to `http://localhost:3000` in background.js
- Tools create tasks that Chrome extension polls every 5 seconds
- Original implementation pattern (generate → poll → execute) is reused
- No changes needed to Chrome extension's task execution logic
