# Gemini Services Refactor Summary

## What Was Changed

### Old Structure (Deleted)
- `src/services/gemini.ts` - Email/calendar template generation (unstructured)
- `src/services/gemini-structured.ts` - Screenshot analysis and task generation (structured)
- `src/services/gemini_chat.ts` - Chat response generation

### New Structure
```
src/services/gemini/
├── index.ts                    # Central export point
├── screenshot.ts               # Screenshot summarization (structured)
├── timeline.ts                 # Timeline generation (structured)
├── tasks.ts                    # Automatic task detection & generation
├── task-templates.ts           # Email/calendar template generation
└── chat.ts                     # Conversational AI responses
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Single Import Point**: All gemini functionality now imports from `../../services/gemini`
2. **Conflict Prevention**: Each function type is in its own file, preventing merge conflicts
3. **Structured First**: Removed unstructured versions - all functions use structured JSON output
4. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns:
   - `screenshot.ts` - One responsibility: summarizing screenshots
   - `timeline.ts` - One responsibility: generating timeline entries
   - `tasks.ts` - One responsibility: detecting actionable tasks
   - `task-templates.ts` - One responsibility: generating email/calendar templates
   - `chat.ts` - One responsibility: generating chat responses

## Updated Imports

All the following files were updated to use the new import path:

- `src/routes/index.ts` - Already correct, no change needed
- `src/routes/monitor/index.ts` - Updated from `gemini-structured` to `gemini`
- `src/routes/chat/index.ts` - Updated from `gemini_chat` to `gemini`
- `src/services/streaming.ts` - Updated from `gemini-structured` to `gemini`

## Build Status
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ All imports resolved
✅ No breaking changes to exported functions
