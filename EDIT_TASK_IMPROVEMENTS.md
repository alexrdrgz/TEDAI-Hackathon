# Edit Task Feature - Context & Confirmation Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. **Confirmation flow wasn't clear** - Users needed explicit confirmation in chat before sending
2. **Chat wasn't getting full context** - AI needed better initial context and editing instructions

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt (`backend/src/services/gemini/chat.ts`)

**Before:** Tools were mentioned but editing workflow wasn't explicit

**After:** Added detailed EDITING WORKFLOW section:
```
EDITING WORKFLOW:
- When a user is editing an email or calendar task, help them make changes conversationally
- Ask clarifying questions to understand what they want to change
- After making edits, summarize the final details and ask for explicit confirmation
- Only call the send_email or create_calendar_event tool AFTER the user explicitly confirms
- Present the final details clearly before asking for confirmation
```

### 2. Improved Tool Descriptions

**sendEmail.ts:**
- Added: "IMPORTANT: Only use this tool AFTER the user has explicitly confirmed they want to send the email"
- Added: "Always present the final email details and ask for confirmation before calling this tool"

**createCalendarEvent.ts:**
- Added same confirmation requirements for calendar events
- Emphasizes asking for explicit user confirmation

### 3. Better Initial Context (`frontend/components/chat-interface.tsx`)

**Before:**
```
I'd like to edit this email task:
To: john@example.com
Subject: Meeting
Body: Let's meet...
```

**After:**
```
I need to edit this email draft:

📧 EMAIL DETAILS:
To: john@example.com
Subject: Meeting

Body:
Let's meet...

---
Please help me make any changes I need. When I'm satisfied with the edits, I'll ask you to send it.
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Uses emojis for visual clarity (📧 for email, 📅 for calendar)
- ✅ Structured format that's easier to parse
- ✅ Explicit instruction about when to send/create
- ✅ Sets expectation for the workflow

### 4. Visual Confirmation UI

Added three layers of visual feedback:

**a) Top Banner - During Editing:**
```
🔵 Blue banner: "Editing {type} task"
```

**b) Top Banner - After Completion:**
```
🟢 Green banner: "✓ Task prepared! Gmail/Calendar will open shortly"
```

**c) Success Card in Chat:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✓  Email Ready to Send!              │
│    Gmail will open with your email.  │
│    Review and click send when ready. │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 5. State Management

Added `taskCompleted` state to track when tools are called:
- Prevents duplicate deletion attempts
- Shows/hides appropriate UI elements
- Provides clear visual progression

## Expected User Flow

### Email Editing Example:

1. **User clicks Edit** → Chat opens with formatted email details
2. **User:** "Change the subject to 'Quick Sync'"
3. **AI:** "I've updated the subject. Here are the final details:
   - To: john@example.com
   - Subject: Quick Sync
   - Body: [original body]
   
   Would you like me to send this email now?"
4. **User:** "Yes, send it"
5. **AI calls tool** → Response shows "✓ Email prepared..."
6. **Success UI appears:**
   - Green banner at top
   - Success card in chat
   - Toast notification
7. **Gmail opens** → User can review and send

### Calendar Editing Example:

1. **User clicks Edit** → Chat opens with formatted event details
2. **User:** "Move it to 3pm and add Conference Room A"
3. **AI:** "I've updated the event:
   - Title: Team Meeting
   - Time: Today at 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM
   - Location: Conference Room A
   
   Would you like me to create this event?"
4. **User:** "Yes, create it"
5. **AI calls tool** → Success UI appears
6. **Google Calendar opens** → User can save the event

## Key Behavioral Changes

### AI Will Now:
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions about edits
- ✅ Summarize all changes before executing
- ✅ Explicitly ask for confirmation ("Would you like me to send/create...?")
- ✅ Only call tools after explicit user approval
- ✅ Present details in a clear, structured format

### AI Will NOT:
- ❌ Call tools without confirmation
- ❌ Assume user wants to send immediately
- ❌ Skip the confirmation step

## Visual Feedback Summary

| State | Top Banner | Chat Display | Toast |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Editing | Blue: "Editing task" | Normal messages | - |
| Tool Called | Green: "Task prepared" | Success card | "Email/Event ready!" |

## Files Modified

1. `backend/src/services/gemini/chat.ts` - Enhanced system prompt with editing workflow
2. `backend/src/services/tools/sendEmail.ts` - Added confirmation requirements
3. `backend/src/services/tools/createCalendarEvent.ts` - Added confirmation requirements
4. `frontend/components/chat-interface.tsx` - Better context + visual confirmation UI

## Testing Confirmation Flow

1. Generate test task
2. Click Edit
3. Make changes conversationally
4. **Verify AI asks for confirmation** with summary of changes
5. Respond with "yes" or "send it" or "create it"
6. **Verify success UI appears:**
   - Green banner at top
   - Success card in messages
   - Toast notification
7. Verify Gmail/Calendar opens

## What Makes This Better

### Context Improvements:
- Structured format with emojis is more scannable
- Explicit instructions set expectations
- All details visible at a glance
- Clear separation between fields

### Confirmation Improvements:
- Multi-layer visual feedback (banner + card + toast)
- AI explicitly asks before calling tools
- User has control over when to execute
- Clear indication of success state

### User Experience:
- No surprises - AI always asks first
- Clear visual progression through states
- Multiple confirmation signals
- Easy to understand what's happening
